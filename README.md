Technology Stack: Spring Boot, ORM(Hibernate), Junit(for testing), REST API, Spring MVC, Java8

Description:
3141 years.
The universe is explored and divided.
The Supreme Ruler appoints the Lords of the Planets, the total number of which is estimated in millions.
Experienced Overlords can control multiple Planets at the same time. There is no democracy, so only one Ruler can rule one planet.
All this outrage requires a system of accounting and supervision.
